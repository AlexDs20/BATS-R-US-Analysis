- Fixed the xlim ylim zlim conditions that did not hold through plots
- Included code to set the colorbar transparency (setProperties function) as well, however, it does not work.
  The transparency only sets if I do it manually (ie not in a script) and it does not stick :(
  (Maybe this works in later matlab releases?)
