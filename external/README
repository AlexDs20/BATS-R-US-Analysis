These are utilities obtained from MathWorks File Exchange which are necessary
to make the plots smoothly.

1)  colormap and colorbar utilities.
    From this package, I use the cmapping function. It allows to convert the
    color data of a color plot (e.g. a surface) into "True Color" (Data in RGB)
    This is then used to put all the plots on the same axes so that, even
    though the plots are done at different times, they are on the same axes
    and therefore look nice like in 3D and not superposed on top of each other.

2)  Quiver Color and Length management
    Currently only the color function is used.
    It allows to give the quiver plot colors depending on the magnitude.
    The Length function is not used yet but may be implemented later on.
    It would allow to make e.g. all vector of the same length, or, limit the
    maximum size of a vector, ...
